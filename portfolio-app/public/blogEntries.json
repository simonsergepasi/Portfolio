    "content": "Using the depth sensor and camera of the iPad Pro 2020, we developed a scanning application for INEDIT. The application allows users to scan a room, which can then be used as a backdrop for designing custom furniture. The main scanning module, developed in C#, includes threaded access to sensor images, an unwrapping algorithm, HLSL shader for texture baking, and algorithms for exporting to .obj and .png formats. This project showcases advanced scanning and image processing techniques.",
